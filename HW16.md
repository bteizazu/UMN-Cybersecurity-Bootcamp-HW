## Week 16 Homework Submission File: Penetration Testing 1

#### Step 1: Google Dorking


- Using Google, can you identify who the Chief Executive Officer of Altoro Mutual is:
	- **Karl Fitzgerald (Google Dorking: Google "demo.testfire.net chief executive officer")**

- How can this information be helpful to an attacker:
	- **An attacker might be able to guess an email address for the CEO to start an attack. The CEO probably has access to sensitive files for the company.**

#### Step 2: DNS and Domain Discovery

Enter the IP address for `demo.testfire.net` into Domain Dossier and answer the following questions based on the results:

  1. Where is the company located: **Sunnyvale, CA**

  2. What is the NetRange IP address: **65.61.137.64 - 65.61.137.127**

  3. What is the company they use to store their infrastructure: 

  4. What is the IP address of the DNS server:**65.61.137.117**


#### Step 3: Shodan

- What open ports and running services did Shodan find:
	- **Ports 80 and 443**
	- **Services: Apache Tomcat/Coyote JSP engine**

#### Step 4: Recon-ng
- Reference (Recon-ng activity): https://umn.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-Minnesota-Boot-Camp/uofm-virt-cyber-pt-09-2021-u-lol/-/blob/master/16-Penetration-Testing/1/activities/12_ReconNG/Solved/README.md

- Install the Recon module `xssed`.
	- Commands used:
		-  **recon-ng**
		-  **keys add shodan_api (API key from shodan.io)**
		-  **marketplace install xssed**
		-  **modules load recon/hosts-ports/shodan_ip**
- Set the source to `demo.testfire.net`.
	-	**options set SOURCE demo.testfire.net** 
- Run the module. 
	- 	**run**

Is Altoro Mutual vulnerable to XSS: 
**Yes. A vulnerability was found after running the xssed module.**

### Step 5: Zenmap
Reference (Zenmap activity): https://umn.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-Minnesota-Boot-Camp/uofm-virt-cyber-pt-09-2021-u-lol/-/blob/master/16-Penetration-Testing/2/activities/02_NSE_Scripts/Solved/README.md


Your client has asked that you help identify any vulnerabilities with their file-sharing server. Using the Metasploitable machine to act as your client's server, complete the following:

- Command for Zenmap to run a service scan against the Metasploitable machine: **nmap -sV 192.168.0.10** (IP address of the Metasploitable machine)
 
- Bonus command to output results into a new text file named `zenmapscan.txt`: **nmap -sV -oN zenmapscan.txt 192.168.0.10**
![](/Users/bteizazu/Desktop/Homework 16 screenshots/Zenmap scan 1.png)

- Use Zenmap's scripting engine to identify a vulnerability associated with the service running on the 139/445 port from your previous scan.
	- Zenmap vulnerability script command:
	- **nmap -p 139,445 --script smb-enum-shares 192.168.0.10** 

Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2022-01-25 19:34 PST

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 1.19 seconds

- Once you have identified this vulnerability, answer the following questions for your client:
  1. What is the vulnerability: **smb-enum-shares**

  2. Why is it dangerous: **(Taken from the nmap website: https://nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/smb-enum-shares.html)
  Finding open shares is useful to a penetration tester because there may be private files shared, or, if it's writable, it could be a good place to drop a Trojan or to infect a file that's already there.**

  3. What mitigation strategies can you recommendations for the client to protect their server: **Restrict access to shares (e.g: Restrict write and execute permissions to sudo users only)**
